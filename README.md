## About SUBJECT:
    A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports scripts â€” programs written for a special run-time environment 
    that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are 
    often interpreted (rather than compiled). Primitives are usually the elementary tasks or API calls, and the language allows them to be 
    combined into more complex programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages 
    within a web browser, usage of the shells of operating systems (OS), embedded systems, as well as numerous games.
    A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an
    application, it is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level 
    programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages 
    on mainframes.
